# Code Log

### Day 1: Tuesday 12 July 2022

**Project / Course:**

- One Week Python Course

**Progress:**

I have already completed over 80% of the One Week Python Course and today I have been learning about parameter list ordering and how to unpack args within Python.

The course also covered how to work with errors in Python and how to handle them using the try/except block.

I created a small app that determines if a year is a leap year and using if statements & f strings print out the result. This was from learning about modules and importing the calendar module.

**Projects:**

- Leap year app
